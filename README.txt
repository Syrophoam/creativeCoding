1. ASCII renderer
  https://editor.p5js.org/syrophoam/sketches/JaZ_3-fS-

this was a satisfying one to complete becuase of how tedius it was alligning the charecters as they arent perfect squares.
I also struggled to index the look up table properly after adding noise becuase p5.js continues to render even when indexing
out of bounds so it was hard to find errors. I would like to make one that converts an image into the same ASCII style.

3. mondiron inspired rectangles
   https://editor.p5js.org/syrophoam/sketches/YhPbDC5oO

It was difficult to draw rectangles up against each other becuase of they're randomised size. I also like how stuble the effect is,
its not immeditaly obvious what it's doing until you move the mouse. I would like to colour the rectangles like mondrion.

   
5. filtered noise
   https://editor.p5js.org/syrophoam/sketches/0DSVpzxI0

I'm proud of this one becuase of how long I struggled to make my own FIR filter algorithm. It's also intresting
to implement DSP algorithms in images because of how mathmatically perfect it looks. I could also implement other
filters such as a high pass or band pass.

   
7. JPEG compression emulator
  jpeg.10.toe

Despite having a lot of issues creating this. It always created an intresting output. It quantizes the frequncies of the image before reconstruciting it.
Being not an exact replica of JPEG compression make it just look like an even lower quality jpeg, one you wouldnt see often. This enhances the effect.
A true JPEG compressor would be intresting becuase you would have more control over how the image is reconstructed.

9. tiled feedback
   tile.toe

I like this one becuase despite having a somewhat simple algorithm, it creates an entrancing image. It seems to have unlimited overlaps. I also exported
it to a low quality GIF which gives it a nice pixilated effect. The colours start off nicely but a development of this would involve a proper colour pallete

   
11. spikey ball
   week11.toe (container 1)

Ive always been intrested in the lattice deform sop but have never been able to use it properly. It also inspired me to render the other sop as a wireframe 
which created the effect where it goes in and out of itself. I still only scratched the surface, I would like to be able to use deform to make more intresting
shapes.
