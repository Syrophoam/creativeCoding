1. ASCII renderer
  https://editor.p5js.org/syrophoam/sketches/JaZ_3-fS-

this was a satisfying one to complete becuase of how tedius it was alligning the charecters as they arent perfect squares.
I also struggled to index the look up table properly after adding noise becuase p5.js continues to render even when indexing
out of bounds so it was hard to find errors.

3. mondiron inspired rectangles
   https://editor.p5js.org/syrophoam/sketches/YhPbDC5oO
It was difficult to draw rectangles up against each other becuase of they're randomised size. I also like how stuble the effect is,
its not immeditaly obvious what it's doing until you move the mouse.

   
5. filtered noise
   https://editor.p5js.org/syrophoam/sketches/0DSVpzxI0
  i'm proud of this one becuase of how long I struggled to make my own FIR filter algorithm. It's also intresting
to implement DSP algorithms in images because of how mathmatically perfect it looks.

   
7. JPEG compression emulator
  jpeg.10.toe
Despite having a lot of issues creating this. It always created an intresting output. It quantizes the frequncies of the image before reconstruciting it.
Being not an exact replica of JPEG compression make it just look like an even lower quality jpeg, one you wouldnt see often. This enhances the effect.

9. tiled feedback
   tile.toe
I like this one becuase despite having a somewhat simple algorithm, it creates an entrancing image. It seems to have unlimited overlaps. I also exported
  it to a low quality GIF which gives it a nice pixilated effect.

   
11. spikey ball
   week11.toe (container 1)

Ive always been intrested in the lattice deform sop but have never been able to use it properly. It also inspired me to render the other sop as a wireframe 
which created the effect where it goes in and out of itself.
