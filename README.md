1. ASCII renderer
  https://editor.p5js.org/syrophoam/sketches/JaZ_3-fS-

this was a satisfying one to complete becuase of how tedius it was alligning the charecters as they arent perfect squares.
I also struggled to index the look up table properly after adding noise becuase p5.js continues to render even when indexing
out of bounds so it was hard to find errors.

3. mondiron inspired rectangles
   https://editor.p5js.org/syrophoam/sketches/YhPbDC5oO
It was difficult to draw rectangles up against each other becuase of they're randomised size. I also like how stuble the effect is,
its not immeditaly obvious what it's doing until you move the mouse.

   
5. filtered noise
   https://editor.p5js.org/syrophoam/sketches/0DSVpzxI0
  i'm proud of this one becuase of how long I struggled to make my own FIR filter algorithm. It's also intresting
to implement DSP algorithms in images because of how mathmatically perfect it looks.
